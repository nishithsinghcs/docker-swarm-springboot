DOCKER and Springboot deployment demo with swarm implementation -

To deploy a Spring Boot application using Docker Swarm, you can follow these steps:

Dockerize your Spring Boot application:
Create a Dockerfile in the root directory of your Spring Boot project.
Use a base image that supports Java, such as adoptopenjdk or openjdk.
Copy your Spring Boot application JAR file into the Docker image.
Set the entry point to run the JAR file using the Java command.
Here's an example of a Dockerfile for a Spring Boot application:
Dockerfile
Copy code
FROM adoptopenjdk:11-jdk-hotspot

COPY target/my-spring-boot-app.jar /app.jar

ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/app.jar"]
Build the Docker image:

Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of your Spring Boot project.
Run the following command to build the Docker image:
shell
Copy code
docker build -t my-spring-boot-app .
Replace my-spring-boot-app with the desired image name.
Initialize Docker Swarm:

Run the following command to initialize Docker Swarm:
shell
Copy code
docker swarm init
Deploy the application as a Docker service:

Run the following command to deploy the Spring Boot application as a Docker service:
shell
Copy code
docker service create --name my-spring-boot-app --replicas 3 -p 8080:8080 my-spring-boot-app
Replace my-spring-boot-app with the name of your Docker image.
Verify the deployment:

Run the following command to list the running services:
shell
Copy code
docker service ls
You should see your Spring Boot application service listed.
Access the application by visiting http://<swarm-node-ip>:8080 in a web browser, where <swarm-node-ip> is the IP address of any node in your Docker Swarm.
Note: Docker Swarm provides a container orchestration solution for running distributed applications across multiple nodes. Make sure you have Docker Swarm configured and running on your environment before following the steps above.
